        <p>I'm not a professional photographer and I definitely don't own a DSLR but whipping
            out my phone to take photos has become a norm for me, especially with the rise
            of social media. As I scroll through my phone gallery, there are some rather common
            themes among the photos present and I would like to share the top three things
            that I enjoy photographing.</br></p>
        <h3></br>1. Gifts</h3>
        <img src="photography1.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p></br>I realised that I really really like to take photos of gifts from my friends but
            to spare you the trouble of scrolling through the tons of photos, I shan't post all
            of them here. (JK I'm just lazy to upload them) The above image were gifts from my friends
            who went overseas: the Dalecarlian horse from Sweden, a pair of cat plushies with one of them wearing
            a red scrunchie and the packs of milk tea from Malaysia, the cardboard box containing a delicate
            metal bookmark from China, the cow plushie from Japan and the nougat green tea biscuit from Taiwan.</p>
        <h3></br>2. Food</h3>
        <img src="photography4.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>Surprise surprise. As one of my motivations to continue living, food definitely plays a huge role
        in reducing my phone's available memory. I like to photograph all kinds of food, be it the trashy dining hall
        food that makes people wonder where in the world did the money they paid for their meal plan disappear to
        (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/dining_hell/">here</a>'s some photographic evidence of the atrocity - disclaimer
        it's not taken by me) or aesthetic food that I paid money for the sole purpose of taking photos and not wanting
        to eat it because it's too pretty.</p>
        <h3></br>3. Embarrassing Moments</h3>
        <img src="photography3.jpeg" alt="" />
        <p>Yeap I love videoing or photographing embarrassing moments of <b>my friends</b> (not myself) so that I can
        laugh at them when I feel sad. @Friends don't worry your secret is safe with me. I won't post them here but I'll
        keep them to myself as treasured memories to hold on to (and laugh about).</p>
