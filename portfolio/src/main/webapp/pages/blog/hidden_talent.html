            <h3><br />Drawing and Painting</h3>
            <p>
              I'm not a professional artist but I have always enjoyed drawing
              and painting since young. It started off with my parents sending
              me for art lessons since young. Back then I was still a grumpy
              child who disliked the crayons and watercolour art classes that my parents
              signed me up for because all I wanted was to ... watch Teen Titans.<br /><br />
              Who knew that this skill will follow me throughout my childhood till my teenage
              years where I experimented with all forms of art - from sketching
              to colour pencils to poster colours and eventually digital art.<br />

              <img class="triple" src="../../images/blog/Ursa.png" alt="" />
              <img class="triple" src="../../images/blog/Draco.png" alt="" />
              <img class="triple" src="../../images/blog/Noctua.png" alt="" />
              <img class="triple" src="../../images/blog/RC4.png" alt="" />
              <img class="triple" src="../../images/blog/Aquila.png" alt="" />
              <br />
              The above designs were created when I helped out my college with
              designing stickers and t-shirts for fundraising sales during Flag
              Day. They represent the five houses in RC4 - Leo, Ursa, Draco,
              Noctua and Aquila. The Orca is the mascot that represents the
              college, as well as the colour Teal.<br /><br />

              <br />The picture above is a snapshot of my work-in-progress in
              drawing Vulpix. I usually have a reference (for colours and
              sketching) but I don't like to trace images as tracing a picture doesn't provide
              the same satisfaction as compared to drawing it from scratch. 
              Adobe Photoshop is my go-to design
              software because of its versatility (although it heats up my poor
              Macbook Pro and significantly slows down my computer &#128577). I wouldn't 
              say that I am extremely good at drawing but it has always been a
              platform for me to destress especially after long hours of
              studying. <br /><br />
              When building websites and applications, I tend to involve myself in the designing of 
              logos and theming of the websites (you can head over to the <a href="../projects.html">projects</a> page 
              to take a look at some of my designs).
