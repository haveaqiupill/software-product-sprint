        <h3></br>Drawing and Painting</h3>
        <p>I'm not a professional artist but I have always enjoyed drawing and painting since young.
            It started off with my parents sending me for art lessons since young. Back then I was still a
            grumpy child who disliked the crayons and watercolour classes because all I wanted was to ... 
            watch Teen Titans.</br></br>Who knew that this skill followed me throughout my childhood till my
            teenage years where I experimented with all forms of art - from sketching to colour pencils
            to poster colours and eventually digital art.</br>

            <img class="triple" src="../../images/blog/Draco.png" alt="" />
            <img class="triple" src="../../images/blog/Noctua.png" alt="" />
            <img class="triple" src="../../images/blog/RC4.png" alt="" />
            <img class="triple" src="../../images/blog/Aquila.png" alt="" />
            </br>
            The above designs were created when I helped out my college with designing stickers
            and t-shirts for fundraising sales during Flag Day. They represent the five houses in RC4 - Leo, 
            Ursa, Draco, Noctua and Aquila. The Orca is the mascot that represents the college, as well as the 
            colour Teal.</br></br></p>

            <p></br>The picture above is a snapshot of my work-in-progress in drawing Vulpix. 
            I usually have a reference (for colours and sketching) but I don't trace the images cause tracing 
            doesn't help me to practice drawing. Adobe Photoshop is my go-to design 
            software because of its versatility (although it heats up my poor Macbook Pro and significantly slows 
            down my computer). I wouldn't say that I am extremely good at drawing but it has always been a platform 
            for me to destress especially after long hours of studying. I don't usually post my pieces online 
            so my friends usually aren't aware that I like to do art (which makes it a hidden talent I suppose).
